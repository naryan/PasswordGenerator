Here is my link to the live site and please write up if you have any suggestions
https://naryan.github.io/homework3/index.html

This website generate password according to the user requested password length. 
This has four checked box for the input that users want to include in the password. 
Numbers, Special characters, Lowercase letters and also Uppercase letter checkbox which users can choose by using a checkbox botton.
It has footer where I have information about myself and a buttons to check out my LinkedIn, Github and my gmail account.

Technologies that I have used to build this website:
Plain html where I have tried my best to use the semantic format.
For the styling I have used the css file where I have target each html divs using id and class.
In javascript I have used four different random function to generate the desired password length randomly.
I have used eventListner on the click function to check if the user wants to include the charcters in the passwprd.
Have used the random function to generate the required password.

It was hard to figure out how to see if the given checkbox are checked and if the boxes are checked, and if checked what boxs are checked. 
It was challenging to find out how to generete random random password while looping the genrate random functions in a sequence.

Starting this homework, I had little knowledge about the callback function and also its importance.
Completing this homework, I have fair knowledge and I feel confidence about it.
